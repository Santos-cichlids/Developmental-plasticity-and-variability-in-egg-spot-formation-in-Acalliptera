# Egg-spot-imaging-paper

This folder contains data generated in the analysis of longitudinal imaging data of A. calliptera 'masoko'/'kisiba', and the R scripts used to generate the figures.
Data files are grouped by R script: one for figures 3, 5, S3 ,S4, S6, S8, and S9 ("Folder A - Figures 3 5 S3 S4 S6 S8 S9") the other for figures 4 and S7 ("Folder B - Figures 4 S7").


Folder A - Figures 3 5 S3 S4 S6 S8 S9:

 - Plots for figs 3 5 S3 S4 S6 S8 S9.R
 R script generating graphs for listed figures using all CSV files in this folder
 
 - individual events for plotting all datasets standardised.csv
 CSV file containing dates of imaging sessions in which defined cellular events (see methods) are first observed, including corresponding information on cohort, morph, days since transferrred to single housing, sex, and clutch. Embryo, yolk closure, and socialised cohorts. Data generated by pheontyping images by eye. Dates and individual naming together correspond to image file names in Dryad.
 
 - all standard lengths.csv
 CSV file containing standard lengths for each individual on each imaging session. Embryo, yolk closure, and socialised (excluding shallow socialised) cohorts. Data generated using Fiji to measure distances from snout to caudal peduncle.
 
 - Melanophore_coverage.csv
 CSV file containing counts of melanophores in each measured fin image and summary data for iridophore appearance. Embryo and yolk closure cohorts. Melanophore coverage data generated using Affinity Photo, ilastik, Fiji (see methods); iridophore appearance summary data from "individual events for plotting all datasets standardised.csv" dataset.
 
 
 
Folder B - Figures 4 S7:

- Figure 4 S7.R
R script generating graphs for listed figures using CSV file in this folder

- Acalliptera_xanthophore_coverage.csv
CSV file containing counts of xanthophores in each measured fin image. Socialised cohort. Data generated using Affinity Photo, ilastik, Fiji (see methods)
